Threadspeaker enables you to listen to your favourite twitter threads.

To make use of it you mention [@threadspeaker](https://twitter.com/threadspeaker) to the last tweet of a thread, and we reply you with a link to the audio version.

You can also visit https://threadspeaker.app/<your-twitter-handler\> to see all threads you've sent to us.
